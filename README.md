# DESCRIPTION

Lets start by describing What a CLI is to allow users to understand the intrigue behind this application.

A **command-line interface** or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or **shell**.
